 <h3>SnakesAndLadders</h3>

A small board game application created using Java. Looking back, I'm surprised I even got that far with this project. Back then, I didn't know what Swing was or how to listen for actions with Listener classes. I remember this was coded within a single day following a Youtube tutorial for Snake.
